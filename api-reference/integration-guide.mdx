This guide will help you integrate the Nexus API into your applications.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- An API key from your [Nexus Dashboard](https://gpt.nexus/App/Integrations)

```

## Basic Integration Steps

1. **Obtain your API key** from the Integrations page in your dashboard
2. **Set up your HTTP client** with the base URL: `https://api.nexusgpt.io`
3. **Include authentication** in all requests
4. **Handle responses** and errors appropriately
